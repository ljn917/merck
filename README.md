Merck Molecular Activity Challenge code

re-implementation of the paper (the recommended model): 

`Ma, J., Sheridan, R.P., Liaw, A., Dahl, G.E. and Svetnik, V., 2015. Deep neural nets as a method for quantitative structureâ€“activity relationships. Journal of chemical information and modeling, 55(2), pp.263-274.`

## Installation
The code was tested in _Keras_ with _Tensorflow_ backend. Python 3 is required.

### Installing python virtual environment and requirements
 ```
 pip install virtualenv
 virtualenv --no-site-packages vkeras
 source vkeras/bin/activate
 pip install pandas numpy keras tensorflow nutsflow nutsml matplotlib

 ```
 

## Running the Code
* Download the training and test data-set from: [Paper supplementary materials](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/ci500747n/suppl_file/ci500747n_si_002.zip)

* Set `data_root` and `save_root` variables in `data_preprocessing.py` and run it (This will remove the features that are not common to both training and test sets and, rescale features and activations).

    * Currently the features are rescaled to 0-1 by dividing each column by its max and the activations are rescaled to their z-score  

* point the `data_root` in `main.py` to where the pre-processed training and test files are located.

* `python main.py`
